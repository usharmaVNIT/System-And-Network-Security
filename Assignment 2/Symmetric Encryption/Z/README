use python 3 . 
All files take input from files and user only has provide input for communication

Key is taken from keys.txt
Code for fiestal cipher is inside fiestalCipher.py and both the files use it

Note for keys

0010 -> 2 , 0001 -> 1 => 00100001 => (21)hex (8 bits) = (33)dec = key1
00010101 -> 21 in dec
block contains 8 bit numbers
So keys = [33 , 21]
